Ncurses (new curses, pronounced "enn-curses") started as a freely
distributable "clone" of System V Release 4.0 (SVr4) curses.  It has
outgrown the "clone" description, and now contains many features which
are not in SVr4 curses.  Curses is a pun on the term "cursor
optimization".  It is a library of functions that manage an
application's display on character-cell terminals (e.g., VT100).
